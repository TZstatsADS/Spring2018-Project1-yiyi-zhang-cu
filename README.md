This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: [Data Story on Inaugural Speeches of POTUS][rawgit.converted] 
+ This project is conducted by Yiyi Zhang  

+ Project summary:  
 
What are the most memorable inaugurable address quotes that you can think of off the top of your head? Below are two of my favorites of all time.

"This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."  
*- Franklin D. Roosevelt, March 4, 1933.*

"My fellow Americans: Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man."  
*- John F. Kennedy, Jan. 20, 1961.*

Although there are a few very memorable, most inaugural addresses have been long forgotten. This notebook will give us a chance to take a closer look at the inaugural speeches of the President of the U.S. (POTUS), but from a data scientic perspective. The scope of the analysis includes 58 Inaugural Speeches of 39 POTUS, which were scrapped from [The American Presidentcy Project][1].

The following factors were considered in this analysis.  

*   Overall and Individual Speeches   
   (a)   The Five Most Famous Speeches   
   (b)   The Most Recent Speeches by the Current President and the Last Three Presidents   
*   Number of Terms Served
*   Political Party
*   Educational Background
*   Career Prior to Politics

**Types of Analysis**
