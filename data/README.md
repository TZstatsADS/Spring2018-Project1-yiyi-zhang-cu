# Project: 
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Below lists the names of the files under this forlder, along with a short description.

*   InauguralSpeeches - A folder that contains files that were scrapped from the website [The American Presidentcy Project](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/inaugurals.php)  
*   InauguationDates.txt - A .txt file that contains the dates of each presidency term.  
*   InaugurationInfo.xlsx - A .xlsx file that includes some basic information about each inaugural speech, such as name of the president, Term, Party, and Word.
